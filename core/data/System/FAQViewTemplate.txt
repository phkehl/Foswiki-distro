---+ FAQ topic templates
This skin template is used to view FAQ questions and answers. It overrides the
content portion of the default view template, and removes the normal form
display, as the FAQForm data is included in the content.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%T% See %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinTemplates for more
information on this topic. The extraneous characters: =%<nop>{...}<nop>%= are
interpreted as comments when this topic is processed as a template.</div>

Include the default view templates from your current SKIN and COVER paths
<verbatim class="tml">
}%
%TMPL:INCLUDE{"view"}%%{
</verbatim>
Override the content template DEFinition. This normally just contains %TEXT%,
but we add some more here to help decorate all the [[FAQForm]] topics in the
same way.
<verbatim class="tml">
}%%TMPL:DEF{"content"}%
---+ Question: %FORMFIELD{"TopicSummary"}%
---++ Answer
%TEXT%

*Back to:* [[%SYSTEMWEB%.%FORMFIELD{"TopicClassification"}%][%FORMFIELD{"TopicClassification"}%]]
----
*Related Topics:* %FORMFIELD{"RelatedTopics"}%%TMPL:END%%{
</verbatim>
Re-define the form DEFinition to be empty; the contents of the from data
have already been displayed above so it wouldn't make much sense to show all
that again at the bottom of each [[FAQForm]] topic.
<verbatim class="tml">
}%%TMPL:DEF{"form"}%%TMPL:END%%{
