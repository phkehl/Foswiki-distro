---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public Internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is backwards compatible with content generated on all previous Foswiki versions, and even content and many plugins from TWiki installations (Foswiki ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work in Foswiki. TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is a registered trademark of Peter Thoeny.)

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%X% *Caution:* If you are upgrading from a release prior to Foswiki 2.1.3, you should review the release notes for 
[[https://foswiki.org/System/ReleaseNotes02x01][Foswiki 2.1]] and [[https://foswiki.org/System/ReleaseNotes02x00][Foswiki 2.0]] for
critical changes.</div>

---++ Known issues
For up-to-date information, see [[https://foswiki.org/Support/KnownIssuesOfFoswiki02x02][Known issues of Foswiki 2.2]]

---+++ Use of non-default ={Store}{Encoding}=

*WARNING* About ={Store}{Encoding}=: If you intend to use high-bit characters in attachment filenames (such as umlauts and accents), then links to these
attachments on Foswiki pages *will not work* on a non-utf-8 Store without modification. This is because Foswiki works internally using Unicode, but the store saves files to disk using your chosen
{Store}{Encoding}. Running the Store with other than =utf-8= encoding is considered a transitional step and not recommended for long-term operation.
The *strongly recommended* solution is to convert your store to UTF8 at the earliest opportunity.

A partial workaround is implemented in the PubLinkFixupPlugin This Plugin will attempt to rewrite broken links.  This _generally_ gets linked images and other attachments working.
However the TinyMCEPlugin is still unable to render image links while editing a topic.

See [[%BUGS%/Item13696][Item13696]] for up-to-date details.

---++ Important changes in Foswiki 2.2

---+++ Security issues addressed in this release.

---+++ The default Attachment Link formats have changed.

The attachment link format has been changed to be more flexible.  If you are using the default link formats, no changes are needed.   If you have
overridden the defaults, you should escape any macros in your revised links by changing =%= to =$percnt=.

For example:
<verbatim>
   * Set ATTACHEDFILELINKFORMAT = \n   * [[%ATTACHURL%/$fileurl][$filename]]: $comment
   * Set ATTACHEDIMAGEFORMAT = \n   * $comment: <br />\n     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/$fileurl" alt="$filename" $size />
</verbatim>
changed to:
<verbatim>
   * Set ATTACHEDFILELINKFORMAT = \n   * [[$percntATTACHURL$percnt/$fileurl][$filename]]%IF{"'$comment'=''" else=": $comment"}%
   * Set ATTACHEDIMAGEFORMAT = \n%IF{"'$comment'=''" else="   * $comment: <br />\n"}%     <img src="$percntATTACHURLPATH$percnt/$fileurl" alt="$filename" $size />
</verbatim>

If you don't escape the macros, they will be expanded when the link is initially created which will impact the ability to rename topics.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* Verify the setting of the
=ATTACHEDFILELINKFORMAT= and =ATTACHEDIMAGEFORMAT= settings and adjust per the above examples.</div>

---+++ Additional support for Proxy configurations.

Foswiki has a new option under bin/configure -&gt; Security and Authentication -&gt; Proxies: ={PROXY}{UseForwardedForHeader}=.  Enable this setting
if the Foswiki is accessed through a reverse proxy. Foswiki will the use the =X-Forwarded-For= header to determine the Client IP address.  This has several effects:
   * Foswiki will log the real Client IP address instead of the address of the reverse proxy server.
   * Session IP matching will use the real client IP when determining if the CGI Session is for the correct client.
   * Plugins that perform security functions based upon the IP address will see the real client IP address.
This setting should only be enabled if the majority of the clients access the server via the reverse proxy.  It is possible for clients to spoof the
=X-Forwarded-For= header, so only enable this setting when appropriate to avoid client IP Address spoofing.

---++ Important changes in Foswiki 2.1

---+++ Deprecations

The =%<nop>HTTP%= and =%<nop>HTTPS%= macros are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  These macros now restrict the available information to the
=Accept-language= and =User-Agent= headers.  The list of available headers is now configurable.

The PatternSkin created =contentheader= and =contentfooter= as aliases for the =beforetext= and =aftertext= templates and deprecated the older templates.  As
this broke compatibity with other skins, that deprecation has been reversed.  For best compatibiliy continue to use =beforetext= and =aftertext=.

---++ API Change

The Foswiki API version is incremented to version 2.4 in Foswiki 2.1.0.  Foswiki 2.1 permits template names using Unicode characters.

---+++ Improvements in International Character Set support

Foswiki 2.1 has further improved support for =utf-8= based character sets. Topics and data forms can use utf-8 characters.  They will be properly rendered and
preserved during edit.   The Foswiki core has been fully converted to utf-8 and unicode. All encoding / decoding is done "at the edge", when reading from
/ writing to the Foswiki store.

   * Foswiki 2.1 International support
      * Emails sent by Foswiki now fully support International Character Sets.
      * Foswiki now uses NFC Normalization of Unicode characters. This greatly improves compatibility with Operating Systems like OSX which use NFD form characters by default.
      * Template names are no longer restricted to ASCII characters. 

   * Foswiki 2.0 International support
      * New sites will use utf-8 by default.  Internationalizaiton should just work.
      * Sites migrating data from a previous installation have two choices:
         * Set ={Store}{Encoding} to match the previous ={Site}{CharSet}=. (Default was =iso-8859-1=)
         * Migrate the data to utf-8 by using the =tools/bulk_copy.pl= script. This is the recommended solution.
      * Support for Locales is still known to have issues.  ={UseLocales}= should not be enabled in the configuration.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you are upgrading an existing system, you
should review the existing data and determine if migration to utf-8 should be performed.
See the [[%FO%/System.UpgradeGuide][UpgradeGuide]] for more details. Note that the topic and
attachment name filters no longer filter international characters, so migration to utf-8 is
strongly recommended.

Due to the extensive internal changes, extensions may require changes for
compatibility with this release.
   * See [[%FO%/Support.Utf8MigrationConsiderations][Utf8MigrationConsiderations]] for guidance on upgrading local extensions
   * See [[%BUGS%/Item13483][Item13483]] for known extensions compatibility issues.
