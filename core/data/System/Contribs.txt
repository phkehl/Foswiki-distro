---+ Foswiki Contribs

Extensions to Foswiki that are not [[%SYSTEMWEB%.plugins]]

%TOC%

---++ Overview

The term "Contrib" is used to refer to any package that is not just a simple plugin. 

Foswiki contribs may
   * extend the functionality of Foswiki, in a lower-level way than plugins,
   * or provide alternative implementations for sections of the Foswiki core e.g. user management, or when an extension just can't be implemented as a plugin because it requires very close access to Foswiki internals,
   * or they might provide other files that Foswiki uses, for example language files,
   * or they might be packages of topics that implement a "Wiki Application", using the wiki macro language, TML.

*Relevant links on Foswiki.org:*
   * Foswiki:Extensions - list of all contributed contrib packages
   * Foswiki:Development - where developers get started

*See other types of extensions:* [[ContributedAddOns][AddOns]], [[Plugins]], [[Skins]]
